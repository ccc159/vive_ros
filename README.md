## Under Construction

As of June 2017, the Vive still does not officially support Linux yet. Altough linux builds of SteamVR and OpenVR are available, they are not fully functional. Therefore direct package build is not functional yet.

A detour is now to send tracking info from Windows to ROS through `rosbridge`. More developments will be updated.
